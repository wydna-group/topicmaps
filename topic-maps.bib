                  several years to discover that, although SGML and XML helped,
                  they did not actually solve the problem. Later I discovered
                  topic maps, and it seemed to me that here was the missing
                  piece that would make it possible to really find what you
                  were looking for. This article is about why I still think

  title    = "The Syntactic Web: Syntax and Semantics on the Web",
  author   = "Robie, Jonathan",
  abstract = "XQuery is a query language designed to allow queries across the
              many kinds of information that are represented in XML. Although
              topic maps and RDF can also be represented in XML, many have held
              that their many possible syntactic forms make them extremely
              difficult to query using an XML query language, and that they can
              only be queried using special-purpose query languages with
              built-in knowledge of their semantics, including the ability to
              exploit RDF schema information. This talk shows that XQuery can,
              in fact, be used to solve the kinds of queries for which RDF and
              topic map query languages were designed, though with a loss of
              type safety. The approach taken is to transform instances of RDF
              and topic maps to a syntactic representation that closely models
              their underlying logical models, and to use function libraries
              written in XQuery to directly support operations specific to RDF
              or topic maps. Schema level information is also incorporated in
              this representation, and is supported in the library, so queries
              can exploit type hierarchies and perform joins across predicates.
              Information from other XML sources can also be queried together
              with information from topic maps and RDF. For instance, a query
              on a topic maps that searches for Shakespeare plays mentioned in
              Italian operas can also query the plays themselves-represented in
              XML-to determine which Italian cities are mentioned in them.
              Syntax is not the opposite of semantics, it is a medium for
              semantics.",

               do the same job? Are there some kinds of Topic Maps constraints
               that are easier to specify with one of them? Do you need
               different background to use the tools? Is it possible to use
               them in similar situations (the same topic maps instances)? May
               we use them to produce an equal result? How do AsTMa!, OSL,

  abstract  = "To be faced with a document collection and not to be able to
               find the information you know exists somewhere within it is a
               problem as old as the existence of document collections.
               Information architecture is the discipline dealing with the
               modern version of this problem: how to organize web sites so
               that users can actually find what they are looking for.
               Information architects have so far applied known and well-tried
               tools from library science to solve this problem, and now topic
               maps are sailing up as another potential tool for information
               architects. This raises the question of how topic maps compare
               with the traditional solutions, and that is the question this
               paper attempts to address. The paper argues that topic maps go
               beyond the traditional solutions in the sense that they provide
               a framework within which they can be represented as they are,
               but also extended in ways which significantly improve
               information retrieval.",
